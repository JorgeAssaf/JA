# Introduction

Welcome to my first post! In this article, we will explore the basics of Markdown and how it can be used to format text in a simple and efficient way.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write plain text using simple syntax and convert it into HTML or other formats. It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 with the goal of making it easy to write and read structured documents.

## Markdown Syntax

Markdown provides a set of simple and intuitive syntax rules for formatting text. Here are some examples:

### Headings

You can create headings using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols determines the level of the heading.

Example:

<Link href='/posts/post-2'>Next Post</Link>

```typescript
const Button = ({ variant, children }) => {
  return (
    <button className={`btn btn-${variant}`}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadmann7/shadcn-table
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pnpm

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and update the variables.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. Push the database schema

   ```bash
   pnpm run db:push
   ```
